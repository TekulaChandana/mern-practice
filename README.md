# MERN Practice Repository

📘 **About This Project**  
This repository documents my **MERN Stack revision journey**, where I revisited and practiced core web development concepts — from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals to React-based front-end development.

Each folder represents a focused area of revision:

- `html-practice` – Revising core HTML concepts and structure
- `css-practice` – Strengthening styling fundamentals and responsive layouts
- `javascript-practice` – Revising JavaScript logic, DOM manipulation, and ES6+ concepts
- `react-practice` – Rebuilding small React apps and components to refresh React concepts

I revised these concepts by following tutorials from **Complete Coding by Prashant Sir** on YouTube.  
All examples and code in this repository are based on his publicly available tutorials.  
This repository is created purely for **personal revision and educational purposes**, and all credit for the original content goes to _Complete Coding by Prashant Sir_.

🎯 **Purpose**

- To **revise and strengthen** my understanding of the MERN Stack
- To **rebuild key projects and examples** for better retention
- To **organize my revision work** for quick future reference
- To **stay consistent** with daily hands-on coding practice

🧠 **Topics Revised**

- **HTML:** Document structure, tags, forms, tables, semantic elements
- **CSS:** Layouts, flexbox, grid, transitions, animations, responsive design
- **JavaScript:** DOM handling, events, ES6+, array methods, and small logic projects
- **React:** Components, props, state, hooks, router, and reusable UI building
